# FastAPI + Streamlit with Nginx Reverse Proxy

This repository contains a containerized web application using FastAPI for the backend API, Streamlit for the frontend, and Nginx as a reverse proxy. The application is orchestrated using Docker Compose.

## Architecture

Client Request → Nginx (Port 80) → FastAPI (Port 8000)
→ Streamlit (Port 8501)


- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy that routes requests to the appropriate service
- **FastAPI**: Backend API service
- **Streamlit**: Frontend web application

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Python 3.12 (for local development)
